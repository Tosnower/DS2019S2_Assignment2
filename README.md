This is our group assignment of designing and implementing distributed shared whiteboard implemented in Java, which allows multiple clients over the network to perform a series of simultaneous actions in the graphical user interface (GUI), including:
<br>➢ Choose the colour.
<br>➢ Free draw with the mouse.
<br>➢ Insert lines that can be changed the length and moved.
<br>➢ Insert different shapes (oval, circular, square, rectangular) that can be resized and moved. ➢ Insert text using different fonts.
<br>➢ Use an eraser of five sizes.
<br>➢ New, open, save, save As and close.
<br>Besides, this whiteboard also provides a text-based chat window that allows all current users of the system to broadcast messages in the whole group or chat in private. Users are able to choose emoticons or use the translation function in the input box when chatting.
<br><br>Using “java -jar ” to open jar packages.
<br>Need JDK 1.8 or higher version.
